things to do:
- give a good reason about maths for the precise relationship between various notions of symmetry
- go through references/cites and add Definition/Theorem/etc. references 
- add a discussion on fairness somewhere
- put honours thesis on gitlab (after adding comment about proof being communicated via email from Noah Stein). 
- would have to define groupid, wreath product, group, bijection, homomorphism, antihomomorphism, isomorphism, automorphism,
