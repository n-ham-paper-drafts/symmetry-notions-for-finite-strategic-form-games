    \begin{abstract}
    		In this paper we survey various notions of anonymity and symmetry for finite strategic-form games present in relevant literature, and discuss notions of fairness; show that game bijections and game isomorphisms form groupoids; introduce matchings as a convenient characterisation of strategy triviality; and outline how to construct and partially order parameterised (symmetric) games with examples that range all combinations of surveyed symmetry notions, which when combined with other results in this paper gives the precise relationship between the various symmetry notions.

    \section*{Acknowledgements}
    		Part of the time spent conducting research for and typesetting this paper was supported by a Tasmania Graduate Research Scholarship (186). The author would especially like to express his gratitude towards:
    		\begin{enumerate}
    			\item Des FitzGerald, without whom the author would unlikely have been able to explore symmetric games for the thesis component of his honours year at the University of Tasmania, and who has been useful for advice since;
	    		\item Noah Stein who introduced the author to his doctoral work at MIT after commenting about his work on what was a discussion based website called Reddit (note the author had already identified and pointed out the mistake by Maskin and Dasgupta, and was working on the label-independent notions at the time of coming across Noah), and who answered a number of questions from the author, many of which were rather stupid in hindsight. Note the author purposefully omitted Noah from the acknowledgements in previous versions of this paper uploaded to the arXiv due to the author's uncertainty about whether the author would be considered a crank and dismissed without justification;
	    		\item Asaf Plan who identified a mistake with the proof of Theorem \ref{basicsymequivthm}, which the author has since corrected (the author apologises that he forgot to acknowledge Asaf in at least one version uploaded to the arXiv since Asaf pointed the mistake out);
	    		\item Jeremy Sumner for proof-reading early drafts with a number of useful corrections;
	    		\item Frigyes Podmaniczky who woke the author up to the annoying issues with the historical convention of listing players 1 and 2 along the rows and columns for games with $n \geq 3$ players;
	    		\item several anonymous referees whose useful comments have helped improve the exposition of this paper along with suggesting a number of relevant references; and
	    		\item Martin Osborne, whose {\tt sgamevar} {\LaTeX} style file, see \cite{SGAMESTY}, was used for the example games throughout this paper.
    		\end{enumerate}
